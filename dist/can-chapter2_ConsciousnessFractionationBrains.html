                    <h2 class="text-titlecase text-left text-white font-weight-bold" >Raising Veal</h2>
                  <p class="text-left text-white ">When I was 9 or 10, before my Dad died, when the family farm was still mildly functional, I joined the 4H Club, whose mission statement is  now "to empower youth to be responsible, caring and contributing leaders that effect positive change in the world around them". At that time, the 4H was agricultural skill-centric.

                  <br><br>One of the 4H badges I decided to earn was 'veal'.

                  <br><br>So a calf was bought and put into it's own stall. Each day, it was my task to mix several cupfuls of milk concentrate powder with 2 litres of tap water; trudge to the stall door, wiggle the bolt, and slug the bucket up onto a wall hook as the eager calf nudged and nostled me and sprayed froth from its whiskered steamy nostrils with gurgled snorts of joy. It's eyes were the color of dark glistening pond water. Between them a tuft of soft hair fell from the crown of its skull; and it liked to be rubbed on the chest and forehead; after drinking, it would moan appreciatively and press me playfully back against the stall's wood wall, rubbing my chest with its head.

                <br><br> I made the mistake of naming it. Would call out its name as I entered the barn and hear its cry in response. When the time came for butchering, my Mom and I agreed: we couldn't eat this animal. And he (no one in the family can remember the calf's name) just simply disappeared. My Dad had led it to the butcher. I dropped out of 4H.

                  <br><br>How beautiful and brutal the world is. </p>
